JournalMe: Track you mental health with an online journal and get a weekly color report to let you know how your emotional health is doing.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by our own experience journaling, and a desire to make that process better through the power of technology. We hope our web app will be a helpful tool to those who want to have fun and get into the habit of journaling. 
 
## What it does
Our web app asks a simple question: “How was your day?”. In a line or two the user can input their thoughts and save it to their online journal. These entries are saved in a table and displayed to the user. In the future, using Google’s Natural Language Processing API, these entries will be color coded based on the sentiment of each statement. Users will receive a weekly or monthly report so they can see how their mood changes over time. In addition, if a user enters text that indicates they are potentially a danger to themselves, they will be connected to a Resources page that contains information on where they can get help.
